Piano Player is a macro-like application mainly designed to work on the http://virtualpiano.net/ website, but can work on other
websites and applications as well. Piano Player is designed to play a keyboard piano by simulating physical keyboard input.

The project is written in both C# and Java (but mainly C#), and doesn't require Java to be installed in order to run.
The IDE used to write the C# code is Visual Studio while Eclipse is used for Java.

If you wish to create your own fork of this project, make sure you have Visual Studio installed as well as the ".NET Desktop development"
workload installed, and if you wish to modify the Java code then make sure you have the Eclpise IDE installed and make sure the Java
compiler compliance level is set to 1.8 so that the project is always exported with the Java 8 version because exporting the Java
project using a higher version will result in having to install the higher version of Java which most users don't do.
